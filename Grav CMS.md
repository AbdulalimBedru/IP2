Grav is a modern, open-source, flat-file Content Management System (CMS) that doesn't rely on a traditional database. It stores content in simple text files (Markdown, YAML, etc.) and uses a flexible templating engine for easy customization. Itâ€™s designed to be lightweight, fast, and developer-friendly, with a focus on simplicity and flexibility.

Pros:
Lightweight and Fast: No database means faster page loading and simpler setup.
Flexibility: Highly customizable with a large number of plugins and themes.
Developer-Friendly: Easy to integrate with modern development workflows (e.g., Git, version control).
No Database: Simplifies backup and migration since everything is stored in flat files.
Flat-file Structure: Ideal for small to medium-sized websites with simple content needs.
Cons:
Learning Curve for Non-Developers: Requires some technical knowledge to fully leverage.
Not Ideal for Large-Scale Sites: Managing a large amount of content can become cumbersome.
Limited Built-In Features: Requires third-party plugins for advanced functionality (e.g., e-commerce, complex forms).
No Built-In User Management: User roles and permissions are limited compared to other CMSs like WordPress.
Limitations:
Not Suitable for Complex Applications: For highly dynamic, data-driven websites, a traditional CMS with a database may be more appropriate.
Content Management for Large Sites: As the site grows, managing large amounts of content can become inefficient.
Lack of Built-In Features: Advanced features often require third-party extensions or manual coding.
Grav is ideal for small to medium-sized websites, static sites, and developers who prefer a hands-on, flexible approach.
